# 1.Installation

You have to ensure that you have installed *Visual Studio Code,PyCharm or any other IDE* of
your choice to begin working with this project. Users are also expected to have installed 
*DB Browser(SQLite)* to be able to handle the database created in this project. 

# 2.Usage

Firstly, you have to run the python file *bookstore* by opening it on you IDE and clicking 
*RUN* or by clicking an inverted triangle pointing to the left which is on the top right corner
if you're using *Visual Studio Code*. After a successful launch, a user is prompted to select a choice 
depending on what they're tasked to do for their project. This project is also making using of 
functions to handle these operations since it makes it easier to perform specific tasks without 
continously writing and running the same SQLite code. The changes made from these operations are automatically
updated to our database and we can confirm this by opening the *DB Browser(SQLite)* and navigating to *OPEN DATABASE*,
select the database from it's root folder and once it's opened you go to *BROWSE DATA* and this is where you
will see all the changes you made to your database.
